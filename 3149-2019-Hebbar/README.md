# Create Multi-arm CONSORT Diagrams the Easy Way with SAS                                                                                 

In clinical trials, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagrams are an important part of the randomized trials report. These diagrams present a bird’s eye view of the flow of patients through the different stages of the trial. The SG procedures do not support a statement for drawing these diagrams. But by completing some data processing steps, you can draw commonly used CONSORT diagrams by using the SGPLOT procedure. You can generate the output in all the formats that are supported by the Output Delivery System (ODS)—and not just RTF! In this paper, we show you how to harness the power of the SGPLOT procedure to create these diagrams.
