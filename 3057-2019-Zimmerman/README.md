# SAS Functions to Drive Source Control with Git                                                                              

Whether you work with Java, C#, or web development technologies, source control plays an 
important role in software development. SAS® is no different. These days, the front runner 
in the source control world is Git. Git is a widely used distributed source control system with 
one remote repository hosted on a website such as GitHub and local repositories on your 
computer. 

This paper provides a look at the Git functions in SAS 9.4M6. Highlights include an 
introduction to the functions and why they were developed; a quick overview of what Git is; 
a series of workflow scenarios that cover the functions; a functions section that describes
 each function;  and an overview of the Git interface in SAS® Studio 3.8.
