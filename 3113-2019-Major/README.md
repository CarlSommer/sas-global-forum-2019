# REST Easier with SAS : Using the LUA Procedure to Simplify REST API Interactions                                                                      This zip file contains 3 lua modules and 2 sas scripts which provide small examples of how to use them.The lua modules are:* rest.lua - sample module for making rest requests* json.lua - module for converting JSON to / from Lua tables* noaa.lua - uses json.lua and rest.lua to provide functionalitry for using NOAA's web service   The modules should be placed in the same folder. The path to this folder needs to be specified at the top of the examples in order for them to work.## Additional informationFind the full paper online with the [SAS Global Forum proceedings](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/program/proceedings.html).## Support contact(s)Contact the author with questions, feedback, and lavish praise.
