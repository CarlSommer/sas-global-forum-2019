# Create a Combined Graph of Tumor Data                                                                                                                 

Traditionally, tumor response and duration of treatment information have been displayed in
separate plots in which the subjects can be sorted by different criteria. In such cases, the
clinician must work harder to associate the subject across the plots. Recently there has
been increased interest in combining this information in one visual. Displaying the data
together, sorted by the tumor response with associated duration information, makes it
easier for the clinician to understand this information. Three-dimensional waterfall plots,
which have both pros and cons, have been proposed for such cases. This paper shows you
how to build a 3-D plot using SASÂ® that shows both tumor response and duration of
treatment. This paper also presents alternative 2-D visuals that were created using the
SGPLOT procedure. These 2-D visuals enable easier decoding of the data, which enables you
to display more information in the plot.
